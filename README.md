The open-source code for The Open Party website

A government is there to server the people in the best interests of the large majority. The government was placed there by the people, paid for by the people, so the 
people should benefit. Turning governments upside down and allowing the people to have a proper democratic say, allowing the people to see what is happening and who is 
who in government, is the ideal of Open Government movement worldwide and The Open Party.
